VSCode

Integration with VSCode is enabled through different configuration and setup
files. The ``settings.json`` [1]_ can be used to define wordwrap etc. if
required. The ``tasks.json`` [2]_ enables definition of tasks that VSCode can
initiate and is used for enabling direct execution of Makefile tasks and avoids
the need for remembering commands for the command line. The file
``.editorconfig`` [3]_ is a file that defines coding styles such as
indetendation, tabs etc. and is a faile that can bu used by a variety of
editors, not just VSCode.
