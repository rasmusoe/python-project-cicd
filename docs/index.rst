Welcome to test project
***********************

Welcome to Python test project documentation. This documentation aims to give
an overview on the template folder structure for developing Pyhton code. The
template sets up different tools used for developing code and outlines where
code etc. needs to be located. Therefor the user can use this template as a
starting point and mainly add source code and the accompanying test code and
only perform minor updates to fit the template into the needs creating a new
Python software package.

The documentation will go into detail of different tools used within the
template and serves as background information and is a must read for first time
developers using this template. There is added links to external information in
the documenttaion and it is advised to dive into this documentation to get a
deeper understanding of the tools used within this Python development
toolchain.

The readme below is a linked copy of the readme from the root of the Git repo.
If you have already read that, it can be skipped.
